# CS441-BounceBallApp

Project 2 - Bouncing App

In this project I have created 3 labels whose names you can modify according to your own wish, I have given them 3 different
types of balls. Also I have added a button at the bottom which is the initialization of the different types of effects that
these labels can perform.
I have added 3 effects to show the animation of the 3 labels, these are -

1. Gravity - The labels will fall off the screen once the button is clicked.
2. Bounce - The labels will bounce up and down on the screen after the button is clicked.
3. Collision - The labels will collide with one another and also bounce once the button is clicked.

This is a simple bouncing ball-application which plays around with different animation effects. For modification, instead of a button at the bottom you can use a slider,a segemented control button,a switch or a stepper.
